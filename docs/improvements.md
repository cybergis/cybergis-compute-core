- port src/lib/python to javascript using the newly released javascript globus sdk
    - would be able to remove pythonutil and simplify things
- get to all the TODOs
- remove all unneeded packages/functions/code
- figure out the purpose of the redis store and possibly archive it
- get rid of the code that just read files -- encapsulate in a class?
- declutter server.ts
    - implement the unimplemented server.ts things?
